# TA Web Apps
When I was a TA in 2018/2019 - I made some simple web apps which I thought would help people understand the material which was being covered 

### Lab 8 Plotter
I forgot the specifics, but Lab 8 for the class I was TAing was about fitting data to a dampened cosine function. The software the students used to do this was not very good, so I wrote a web app to replace it - I don't think it ended up in use because the lab was changed shortly after during the pandemic

### Vector Decomposition
The students were struggling with understanding vector decomposition and why you needed to arctan add a constant to arctan to get the correct angle depending on the quadrant the point was in. I wrote this simple web page to display vector decomposition.
